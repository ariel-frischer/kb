releases:
  - version: "unreleased"
    date: null
    added:
      - description: "Configurable BM25 shortcut thresholds (`bm25_shortcut_min`, `bm25_shortcut_gap`) for ask mode"
        commits: []
      - description: "Query expansion — generates keyword synonyms (FTS) and semantic rephrasings (vector) via local FLAN-T5 or LLM, fuses with multi-list weighted RRF (`--expand` / `--no-expand`)"
        commits: ["e04c35f", "a00068b"]
      - description: "HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) — generates a hypothetical answer passage before vector search for improved retrieval on question-style queries"
        commits: ["59fadc9", "a00068b"]
      - description: "Local HyDE generation via transformers (Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B default) — no API cost alternative to LLM-based HyDE (`hyde_method = \"local\"`)"
        commits: []
      - description: "`local-llm` optional extra (transformers + torch) for local HyDE generation"
        commits: []
      - description: "FTS-only keyword search command (`kb fts`) for fast, no-API searches"
        commits: ["2bfe417"]
      - description: "Positional rank bonuses in RRF fusion scoring"
        commits: ["2bfe417"]
      - description: "`--json` flag for `kb search` and `kb ask` structured output"
        commits: ["cce0a74"]
      - description: "FTS5 trigger-based sync with porter stemming tokenizer"
        commits: ["cce0a74", "5b145f1"]
      - description: "FTS5 field weighting — fts_path (10x), heading (2x), text (1x) via weighted BM25 rank config. fts_path stores last 2 path components to avoid IDF collapse"
        commits: ["62e9c21"]
      - description: "HyDE best-of-two — embeds both raw query and HyDE passage, keeps whichever vec result set has better top-1 similarity (HyDE can only help, never hurt)"
        commits: ["62e9c21"]
      - description: "Tag pre-retrieval filtering — computes tagged chunk IDs and filters vec+FTS before RRF fusion instead of post-filter over-fetch"

        commits: ["5b145f1"]
    fixed:
      - description: "Vec0 now uses cosine distance — previously L2 distance caused `1 - distance` to produce negative similarity, breaking vector search entirely (schema v8→v9, requires reindex)"
        commits: []
      - description: "`kb ask --json` now includes `rerank`, `filters`, `result_count`, `filtered_count` keys (were present in api.py but omitted by cli.py)"
        commits: []
      - description: "Tag filter now uses pre-retrieval filtering — computes tagged chunk IDs and filters vec+FTS results before RRF fusion, so tagged docs are found even when they don't rank globally"
        commits: []
      - description: "BM25 shortcut gap threshold lowered from 0.15 to 0.05 — shortcut now fires in practice (configurable via `bm25_shortcut_gap`)"
        commits: []
      - description: "HyDE no longer hurts vec search — best-of-two approach keeps raw query results when HyDE passage is off-domain"
        commits: ["62e9c21"]
      - description: "BM25 shortcut in ask now deduplicates by document before gap check (LIMIT 20, group by doc_path) — shortcut can actually fire"
        commits: ["62e9c21"]
      - description: "Fused candidate count now captured pre-filter; `after_filters` key added when filters active"
        commits: ["62e9c21"]
      - description: "Common path terms (e.g. project name in every doc_path) no longer get zero FTS weight — fts_path stores last 2 path components"

      - description: "RRF fusion rank bonus application for accurate scoring"
        commits: ["6484412"]

        commits: ["5b145f1"]
      - description: "Enable WAL mode and foreign keys for better DB performance"
        commits: ["5b145f1"]
    changed:
      - description: "Project-mode DB moved to XDG data dir (`~/.local/share/kb/projects/<hash>/kb.db`) — no database files in project directory, WAL sidecar files no longer appear in git status"
        commits: []
      - description: "`kb init --project` no longer creates `.kb/` directory or `.gitignore`"
        commits: []
      - description: "`kb reset` now cleans up WAL sidecar files (`.db-shm`, `.db-wal`)"
        commits: []
      - description: "Schema version upgraded from 4 to 9 (FTS triggers + porter tokenizer + field weighting + fts_path truncation + cosine distance)"
        commits: ["cce0a74", "5b145f1", "62e9c21"]
      - description: "CLI refactored to thin wrappers over `api.py` core functions"
        commits: ["5b145f1"]
      - description: "BM25 shortcut in ask skips embedding/vector/rerank when FTS results are high-confidence"
        commits: ["2bfe417"]
    removed: []
    deprecated: []
    breaking: []
    migration: "Schema auto-migrates from v4→v5→v6→v7→v8→v9. v8→v9 switches vec0 to cosine distance (drops vec_chunks, reindex required via `kb index`). v7→v8 adds fts_path column (last 2 path components) and rebuilds FTS using truncated paths. v6→v7 adds doc_path column to chunks and rebuilds FTS with 3-column weighted BM25."
